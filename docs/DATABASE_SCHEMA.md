## 🔗 Relationships & Integrity

### 1. The Finance Bridge
The `Finance` screen joins `customers` (for **Expected Revenue**), `payments` (for **Collected Revenue**), and `expenses` (for **receipt deductions**). The `monthTag` in payment and expense docs allows for instant filtering without complex date-range logic.

### 2. The Attendance Proxy
The `Home` screen calculates plate counts by:
1. Fetching all `isActive` customers.
2. Checking for specific meal subscriptions (`mealsPerDay`).
3. Overriding counts with any explicit `attendance` records for that day.

### 3. Subscription Renewal Logic
When a payment is recorded, the `customers/{id}` record's `endDate` is pushed forward by 30 days from either `today` (if expired) or `currentEndDate` (if still active).
