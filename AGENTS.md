📌 Application Purpose

Mess Manager is a simple single-user mobile app designed to help a home-based meal service operator track customers, payments, and weekly menu with minimal effort.

The app replaces a physical notebook.

It focuses only on:

Tracking active customers

Monitoring remaining days

Recording payments received

Editing weekly menu

Showing a simple daily overview

This app is intentionally minimal.

It is:

Single user only

No authentication system

No multi-role access

No analytics or reports

No complex dashboards

No scalability considerations

The goal is clarity and ease of use for a non-technical operator.

The application prioritizes:

Large readable UI

One-tap actions

Minimal typing

Zero unnecessary features

This is not a SaaS product.
It is a focused operational tool.
